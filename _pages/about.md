  - **I am** ⚛️ a scientist without borders — My journey spans three continents—Asia, Europe, and America—where chemistry, materials science, and high-energy physics have intertwined to shape my path.

  - **I believe** 〰️ Art is a Science just like science is also an art. I pursue for beautiful results rather than good results. 

  - **I dedicate to** 🔭 push the extreme of X-ray technique — For eight years, I have devoted myself to pioneering fast, single-acquisition dispersive X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy, now reaching the frontier of millisecond resolution.

  - **I thrive** 🪐 on enthusiasm and passion: curious, creative, and relentless in the pursuit of knowledge that bridges disciplines and illuminates new possibilities.
